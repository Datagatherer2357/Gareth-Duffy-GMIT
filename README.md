***Progamming & Scripting problem sets***
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Excercise 1 of Programming and Scripting:**

* fib.py is a program which calculates the 15th Fibonacci number. 
  The program was originally designed to calculate the 30th fibonacci number, and can be amended to calculate any number. 
  15 was used to demonstrate that n (15) was the sum of the first and last letters of my first name (i.e. Gareth...G (7) + h (8) = 15).   
**Excercise 2 of programming and scripting:**

* fibname.py is a program that displays Fibonacci numbers using people's names. 

**Excercise 3 of programming and scripting:**

* collatz.py is a program that demonstrates the sequences of the Collatz conjecture. 

**Excercise 4 of programming and scripting:**

* euler5.py is a program that uses for and range to calculate the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of   
  the numbers from 1 to 20. 
 
**Excercise 5 of programming and scripting:**

* ex5iris.py is Ronald Fisher's Iris dataset formatted with justification of spaces and columns. 

**Excercise 6 of programming and scripting:**

* factorial.py is a program that contains a function called factorial which takes a single positive integer and returns its   
  factorial.
