Gareth-Duffy - GMIT

***GMIT Progamming & Scripting projects:***

* fib.py is a program which calculates the 15th Fibonacci number. The program was originally designed to calculate the 30th    
  fibonacci number, and can be altered to calculate any. 15 was used to demonstrate that n (15) was the sum of the first and   
  last letters of my first name (i.e. Gareth...G (7) + h (8) = 15). (Excercise 1 of Programming and Scripting).

* fibname.py is a program that displays Fibonacci numbers using people's names. (Excercise 2 of programming and scripting).

* collatz.py is a program that demonstrates the sequences of the Collatz conjecture. (Excercise 3 of programming and     
  scripting).

* euler5.py is a program that uses for and range to calculate the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of   
  the numbers from 1 to 20. (Excercise 4 of programming and scripting).

* ex5iris.py is Ronald Fisher's Iris dataset realligned with justification of spaces and columns. (Excercise 5 of programming  
  and scripting).

* factorial.py is a program that contains a function called factorial which takes a single positive integer and returns its   
  factorial.  (Excercise 6 of programming and scripting).
 
* All other files contain programs that are not part of GMIT assignments.

* This repository contains Python code only.
