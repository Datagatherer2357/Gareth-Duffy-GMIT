# loops in Python
# there are 3 types of loops in Python: 
# while, for, nested (types)

# A while loop statement in Python repeatedly 
# executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.

# A loop becomes infinite loop if a condition never becomes FALSE. 
# Use caution when using while loops because of the possibility 
# that this condition never resolves to a FALSE value

# break is used to exit a for loop or a while loop, whereas continue is 
# used to skip the current block, and return to the "for" or "while" statement

# nested loop: A nested loop is a loop inside a loop. 

# for loops:
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
for prime in primes:
    print(prime)

# Prints out the numbers 0,1,2,3,4
for x in range(5):
    print(x)

# Prints out 3,4,5
for x in range(3, 6):
    print(x)

# Prints out 3,5,7
for x in range(3, 8, 2):
    print(x)

# while loop:
# Program to add natural numbers upto sum = 1+2+3+...+n

# To take input from the user,
# n = int(input("Enter n: "))

n = 10

# initialize sum and counter
sum = 0
i = 1

while i <= n:
    sum = sum + i
    i = i+1    # update counter

# print the sum
print("The sum is", sum)

# for and while loops with break and continue statements:

# Prints out 0,1,2,3,4

count = 0
while True:
    print(count)
    count += 1
    if count >= 5:
        break

# Prints out only odd numbers - 1,3,5,7,9
for x in range(10):
    # Check if x is even
    if x % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(x)

# else statement:

# When the loop condition of "for" or "while" statement fails 
# then code part in "else" is executed. If break statement is executed 
# inside for loop then the "else" part is skipped. Note that "else" part 
# is executed even if there is a continue statement:
# e.g.

# Prints out 0,1,2,3,4 and then it prints "count value reached 5"

count=0
while(count<5):
    print(count)
    count +=1
else:
    print("count value reached %d" %(count))

# Prints out 1,2,3,4
for i in range(1, 10):
    if(i%5==0):
        break
    print(i)
else:
    print("this is not printed because for loop is terminated because of break but not due to fail in condition")

# Loop through and print out all even numbers from the 
# numbers list in the same order they are received
# won't print any numbers that come after 237 in the sequence
